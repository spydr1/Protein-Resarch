Training and test sets for protein model structures (often called decoys) are generated to most resemble starting models of real-case refinement problems. 
We reasoned that arelevant decoy structure should meet the following conditions: 
i) has template(s) not too far or close in sequence space; 
ii) does not have strong contacts to other protein chains, 
iii) should contain minimal fluctuating (i.e. missing density) regions. 
To this end, we picked a set of crystal structures from the PISCES server (deposited by May 1, 2018) containing 20,399
PDB entries with maximum sequence redundancy of 40% and minimum resolution of 2.5 Ã….

We further trimmed the list to 8,718 chains by limiting their size to 50-300 residues and requiring that proteins are either monomeric or 
have minimal interaction with other chains(weaker than 1 kcal/mol per residue in Rosetta energy). 

HHsearch 30 was used to search for templates; 
50 templates with the highest HHsearch probability, 
sequence identity of at most 40% and sequence coverage of at least 50% are selected for model generation.
